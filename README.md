## About

An Experiment on Wrapping up electron app with Next.js To run the
electron app as a desktop application.

Here I have seperated the `package.json` for electron and next.js to
make it more clear and easy to understand.

The electron application is in `electron-wrapper` directory and the
next.js application acts as the root directory.

## Docs

- Check the [Electron Documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs) for more
  information.
- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

- Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
